 * 1 unit, and if she bought a toy with weight <tt>w'</tt>, then she gets all
 * other toys whose weight lie between <tt>[w',w'+4]</tt> free of cost.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Input Format<br>
 * The first line contains an integer <tt>N</tt> i.e. number of toys. Next line
 * will contain <tt>N</tt> integers, <tt>w1,w2,...,wN</tt>, representing the
 * weight array.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Output Format<br>
 * Minimum price with which Priyanka could buy all of toys.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints<br>
 * 1<=N<=10<sup>5</sup><br>
 * 0<=wi<=10<sup>4</sup>,where iâˆˆ[1,N]
 * </p>

 * Sample Input<br>
 * 5<br>
