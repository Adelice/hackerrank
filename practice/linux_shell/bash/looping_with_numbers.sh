# For loops in Bash can be used in several ways: - iterating between two integers a and b - iterating between two integer a and b and incrementing by c each time - iterating through the elements of an array, etc.
# 
# Use for loops to display the natural numbers 1 to 50.

for i in {1..50} 
do
  echo $i
done
